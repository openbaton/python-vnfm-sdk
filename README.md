# Python version of the vnfm-sdk
This project contains a vnfm sdk for python projects.

## Technical Requirements
This section covers the requirements that must be met by the python-vnfm-sdk in order to satisfy the demands for such a component:

* python 2.7 or 3.5
* pika

## How to install python-vfnm-sdk

The safer way to start is to use a [virtal environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Once activated, just run

 ```bash
 python setup.py build
 python setup.py install
 ```

After that, in this virtual environment a module *interfaces* will be available from which you can inherit the AbstractVnfm class in this way:

```python
import logging

from interfaces.AbstractVnfmABC import AbstractVnfm

class PythonVnfm(AbstractVnfm):

    def upgradeSoftware(self):
        pass

    def updateSoftware(self):
        pass

    def terminate(self, virtualNetworkFunctionRecord):
        pass

    def scale(self, scaleOut, virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, component, scripts, dependency):
        pass

    def query(self):
        pass

    def notifyChange(self):
        pass

    def modify(self, virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, dependency):
        pass

    def instantiate(self, virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, scripts, vimInstances):
        pass

    def heal(self, virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, vnfcInstanceComponent, cause):
        pass

    def checkInstantiationFeasibility(self):
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level="DEBUG")
    vnfm = PythonVnfm("python")
    vnfm.run()

```

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification.

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
