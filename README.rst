Python version of the vnfm-sdk
==============================

This project contains a vnfm sdk for python projects.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

This section covers the requirements that must be met by the
python-vnfm-sdk in order to satisfy the demands for such a component:

-  python 2.7 or 3.5
-  pika

How to install the python-vfnm-sdk
----------------------------------

The safer way to start is to use a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__. Once activated, just run

.. code:: bash

   pip install python-vnfm-sdk

How to use the python-vfnm-sdk
------------------------------

First step, let's create a configuration file for the VNFManager under: /etc/openbaton/*<type>*/conf.ini (where type is the **endpoint** specified in the vnfd.json)

This file should be like this:

.. code:: ini

    [vnfm]

    log_path=/var/log/openbaton/
    broker_ip=localhost
    username=admin
    password=openbaton
    heartbeat=60
    exchange=openbaton-exchange

where:

   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | name      |    description                                          |
   +===========+=========================================================+
   | log_path  |    path where the logfile will be written               |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | broker_ip |   Ip of the rabbitmq broker used by the nfvo            |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | username  |   username for the rabbitmq broker used by the nfvo     |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | password  |   password for the rabbitmq broker used by the nfvo     |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | exchange  |   exchange name used in the rabbitmq broker by the nfvo |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | heartbeat |   heartbeat for the rabbitmq connection                 |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+


After installing the sdk, you will be able to write a Vnfm that inherit the *AbstractVnfm* class in this way:

.. code:: python

    import json
    import logging.config

    from interfaces.AbstractVnfmABC import AbstractVnfm

    class PythonVnfm(AbstractVnfm):
        def upgradeSoftware(self):
            pass

        def updateSoftware(self):
            pass

        def terminate(self, vnf_record):
            log.info("Executing TERMINATE for VNFR: %s" % vnf_record.get("name"))
            return vnf_record

        def stopVNFCInstance(self, vnf_record, vnfc_instance):
            pass

        def stop(self, vnf_record):
            pass

        def startVNFCInstance(self, vnf_record, vnfc_instance):
            pass

        def start(self, vnf_record):
            log.info("Executing start for VNFR: %s" % vnf_record.get("name"))
            return vnf_record

        def scale(self, scale_out, vnf_record, vnf_component, scripts, dependency):
            pass

        def query(self):
            pass

        def notifyChange(self):
            pass

        def modify(self, vnf_record, dependency):
            log.info("Executing modify for VNFR: %s" % vnf_record.get("name"))
            return vnf_record

        def instantiate(self, vnf_record, scripts, vim_instances):
            log.info("Executing instantiate for VNFR: %s" % vnf_record.get("name"))
            return vnf_record

        def heal(self, vnf_record, vnf_instance, cause):
            pass

        def handleError(self, vnf_record):
            log.info("Executing ERROR for VNFR: %s" % vnf_record.get("name"))
            return vnf_record

        def checkInstantiationFeasibility(self):
            pass



Then you must start it in this way, passing the **type** to the constructor

.. code:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        logging.basicConfig(level="DEBUG")
        vnfm = PythonVnfm("python")
        vnfm.run()

This will register to the NFVO and start wait for the action addressed to the VNFM of type "python" in this example

What is Open Baton?
===================

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive
implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO)
specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part
of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three
years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a
compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification.

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and
provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It
supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or
interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms
(REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with
additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service.
For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on
monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available
at the NFVI level.
